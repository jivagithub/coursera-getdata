### run_analysis.R

## Scope

* 1: Merge the "training" and "test" data sets into one data set
* 2: Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* 3: Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4: Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
* 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Input Data

Both "Train" and "Test" Data consist of three data sets each as follows:
* Measurements (a variety of x,y,z axis measurements)
* Activities being measured (e.g. WALKING, STANDING, etc.)
* Subjects being measured (e.g. person "1", person "2", etc.)
